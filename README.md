# Shadows of the forgotten
There are those who lurk, and wish to be unknown. Their names are written in encrypted tomes (database). This portal, a shimmer at the edge of the fey, (api in golang) is there one last thread holding them to the world of mortals.

## Tagging
I'm using a prebuilt tagging action that uses an angular standard syntax. A tag will be created by bumping a value from a previous tag if the commit message follows a set pattern:

`fix(pencil): ...` <- hotfix version bump

`feat(pencil): ...` <- minor (non-breaking) change

`break(pencil): ...` <- major (breaking) change
